# Denhac Kiosk

The goal of this project was to make a simple Kiosk based on an e-ink Android tablet we had lying around. To that end, it has no color scheme aside from the blacks and greys afforded by the tablet. It was also designed to be put inside a case so there is limited protection for escaping if you have access to physical buttons on the tablet. This is mostly open source so that our members can look at the source, learn from it, and potentially contribute back to it.
